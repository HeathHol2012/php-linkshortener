coded by heath github user: heathhol2012
    - runs on php so use a local server like ISS or alpache or port forward to become public
    - my website will be running this (http://shortify.us.kg/)
    - on server side the usernames and passwords are stored in user.json
    - on server side the links are stored in links.json
    - when upgrading to a newer version of this you can just change the index.php and keep the links.json and user.json
    - if you have any issues with this please make a issue on github and i will try to help!
    - please do not use as anything public as this is not secure in anyway and is just a fun coding project

please note: some of this was coded using cursor (ai coding tool) https://www.cursor.com/,although most of it was coded by hand
