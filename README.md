# php-linkshortener
 a basic link shortener

In the area where it says what the shortened link will be it auto detects the root domain.
the default username and password is admin admin.

at the moment it only allows users that were manually added by the admin panel but in a future update i will add version of the PHP file with a register button

    - runs on php so use a local server like ISS or alpache or port forward to become public
    - my website will be running this (http://shortify.us.kg/)
    - on server side the usernames and passwords are stored in user.json
    - on server side the links are stored in links.json
    - when upgrading to a newer version of this you can just change the index.php and keep the links.json and user.json
    - if you have any issues with this please make a issue on github and i will try to help!
    - please do not use as anything public as this is not secure in anyway and is just a fun coding project

please note: some of this was coded using cursor (ai coding tool) https://www.cursor.com/,although most of it was coded by hand
